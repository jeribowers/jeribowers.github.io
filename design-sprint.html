        <h2>Design Sprint</h2>
        <h3 class="subtitle">Using design thinking to align and collaborate across multiple disciplines</h3>
        <p>The IBM Watson Tooling team converged in Littleton, Massachusetts to hold the very first Watson Tooling Design Sprint. The team was comprised of offering managers, developers, executives, and designers.</p>
        <p>The short-term tactical goal was to extend the current capabilities of the Watson Experience Manager, the tool used to customize and support Watson applications. In 32 hours, we managed to design, iterate, prototype and validate our assumptions. The insights gained would immediately impact the product development of the Watson Experience Manager for the next 3-months and influence the long-term strategic vision.</p>
        <p>We applied user-centered design thinking practices to align and structure our week. The end goal of the Design Sprint was to have an interactive prototype that focused on 4 key areas of tooling: question clustering, question and answer mapping, content ingestion and performance.</p>

        <h4>Teams</h4>
        <p><b>Question clustering</b> - The user scenario was that Kathryn already has a set of questions but doesn’t know how to organize them. Her pain point was that it's cumbersome to cluster and organize questions.</p>

        <p><b>Content ingestion</b> - The user scenario was that Kathryn would upload her content to this tool and suggestions would be given before files are actually ingested. Her pain point was that the tool rejects her content but doesn't give any feedback as to why and doesn’t correctly segment the content.</p>

        <p><b>Question and answer mapping</b> - The user scenario was that Kathryn teaches Watson by mapping questions to answers. Her pain point is that she's unable to map multiple answers or find answers to questions in the tool.</p>

        <p><b>Performance</b> - The user scnario was that Kathryn wants feedback on her activity and actionable insights. Her pain point was that there’s too much data to parse and she doesn’t know what steps to take next.</p>

        <h4>Understand</h4>
        <p>Each day started with people volunteering to give a 5 minute lightning talk on a critical topic that would influence the tooling in some way. There were a wide range of topics covered, from error handling and implications of clustering to tooling for hybrid environments. I shared a lightening talk on design inspiration and how we could delight the user.</p>
        <p>The first step of the design sprint was to understand and to level-set the team. We did this by evaluating the synthesized research that had been completed to-date and review the journey map of the as-is scenario. This helped to align the team on the major pain points we were trying to solve.</p>
        <p>A single UI framework was created for each team to use. This allowed them to focus on the unique challenges of their tool without needing to exert unnecessary time and attention on the surrounding container. This also gave a more consistent look and feel when each team presented their prototype during the final Playback.</p>
        <p>Once everyone was level-set and we understood what the major pain points were, the next step was creating the to-be experience. We divided into teams that included one prototyper, engineer, designer and offering manager. Each team would focus on one tool: question clustering, question and answer mapping, content ingestion or performance. Using design thinking techniques, we brainstormed the ideal experience for our users and created a to-be scenario. We then played back our findings to the overall group.</p>

        <h4>Diverge</h4>
        <p>The next stage of the design sprint was to diverge. We did this by sketching 5 ideas in 10 minutes, then 1 idea in 5 minutes, then 2 storyboards in 15 minutes. Getting all your ideas out on paper, regardless if they're good or bad, can generate huge breakthroughs by forcing people to let go of inhibitions.</p>                
        <p>We played back to our team, used zen voting to garner consensus, then remixed our story board to eventually converge on the best ideas.</p>

      <div class="eight offset-by-two columns">
        <h4>Prototype and validate</h4>
        <p>Prototyping and validating was the third stage of the design sprint. Armed with our new to-be scenario, we began to prototype the user flow with paper. We determined what the user story was going to be and what assumptions we needed to test. Testing with other members of the team allowed us to refine our prototype before testing on proxy users. No matter how big or small, testing can surface invaluable insights that wouldn’t have been uncovered otherwise.</p>
        <p>We quickly transitioned into a <a href="http://jeribowers.github.io/new-xmgr/ver01/index.html">digital prototype</a> that I coded that incorporated the useful feedback we’d received from our users. For the next 2 days, we continued to flush out the user interactions, test on proxy users and played back to the overall team.</p>

        <h4>On the fourth and final day...</h4>
        <p>We held our final playback and shared our end-to-end prototypes with our key stakeholders and the rest of Watson. The 3 1/2 day design sprint encouraged team collaboration and allowed our team to ideate quickly and generate usable prototypes.</p>
